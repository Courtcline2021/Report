# Report
This is an application that uses the reportlab module and creates an expense report in a pdf file. 
It a simple program that will be updated to be a more intune with the user. 
* I am going to update so there is a add, update, and delete section so the user can update the report.
* Need to and some try and except blocks when the code gets more complicated.
* Also what to update the style of the page so it looks more modern.
